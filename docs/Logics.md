**Determine Lead Time of Timeline**

- Case 1: All values are from Order Date
        
        leadTime = leadTime of Last Activity
        
- Case 2: All values are from Ex Factory Date
        
        leadTime = leadTime of first activity (if first activity will occur on the zeroth day)
        
- Case 3: Mix of Order Date and Ex Factory Date
